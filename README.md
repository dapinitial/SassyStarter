# SassyStarter

This is basically the starter code that I use to maintain all my projects, rapidly prototyping, and stubbing out components and focusing on how they will be made accessible. I like to use the W3C's official accessible github maintained by Facebook's Matthew King. I find maintaining in SCSS to be fast and reliable. Watch out for nesting your selectors though! Opt for specific naming or use web components / Shadow DOM!  As you already know, Twitter Bootstrap is great for prototyping and learning to code... however, when you're ready to do it yourself you already know there's a better way to go about this! This isn't another CSS framework this is just an organized approach to doing all the things you need to do in CSS to layout a website. It's everything you never wanted to learn wrapped up tightly in a succinct, simple to use format.

You can use CSSNext and PostCSS to clean things up later.

For now, I would encourage you to:
1.       Use native HTML as much as possible; avoid custom widgets unless you really need them.
2.       Study the patterns and examples in the authoring practices and see if they help.  Let me know where/how they fall short.
3.       Find ways of doing some formal, or even informal, user  research where you can observe how people with various disabilities use the web. Check out https://medium.com/@addyosmani/accessible-ui-components-for-the-web-39e727101a67 and Google's A11yCasts on Youtube.
