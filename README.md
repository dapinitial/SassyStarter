# SassyStarter

This is basically the starter code that I use to maintain all my projects, rapidly prototyping, and stubbing out components and focusing on how they will be made accessible. I like to use the W3C's official accessible github maintained by Facebook's Matthew King. I find maintaining in SCSS to be fast and reliable. Watch out for nesting your selectors though! Opt for specific naming or use web components / Shadow DOM!

You can use CSSNext and PostCSS to clean things up later.

For now, I would encourage you to:
1.       Use native HTML as much as possible; avoid custom widgets unless you really need them.
2.       Study the patterns and examples in the authoring practices and see if they help.  Let me know where/how they fall short.
3.       Find ways of doing some formal, or even informal, user  research where you can observe how people with various disabilities use the web.
